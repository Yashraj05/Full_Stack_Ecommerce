## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
In this project, all the main functionalities have been which should be present in any Ecommerce Project or Online Shopping Project. 

When a user visits our application for the first time, he will be able to see all the Products on the Home Page by default, he can also search the products based on the product categories which was added by the Administrator. After that User can log in and add the products to the Cart, and he can add multiple products to Cart with his required quantity, User can also delete the product from the Cart at any time.

### Installing
```bash
JAVA
```

        ```
        java -version
        ```

   You should see the installed Java version and other details if the installation was successful.

   Set up the JAVA_HOME environment variable. This variable points to the Java installation directory and is required by many Java-based tools and frameworks. The exact steps for setting     the environment variable depend on your operating system:
 
1. Windows:

- Right-click on "My Computer" or "This PC" and select "Properties".
- Click on "Advanced system settings" or "Advanced" tab.
- Click on "Environment Variables".
- Under "System variables" or "System Variables" section, click on "New".
- Enter JAVA_HOME as the variable name.
- Enter the path to your Java installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_221) as the variable value.
- Click "OK" to save the changes.
  
2. macOS/Linux:

- Open a terminal and run the following command to open the environment variable configuration file: ```
        nano ~/.bash_profile
        ```
- Add the following line at the end of the file: ```
        export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/installation
        ``` Replace /path/to/java/installation with the actual path to your Java installation directory
        
- Press Ctrl + X, then Y, and Enter to save the changes and exit nano.

```bash
STS
```
- Visit the Spring Tool Suite download page: https://spring.io/tools

- Scroll down to the "Latest Release" section and click on the download link for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

- Once the download is complete, run the installer executable (.exe file on Windows, .dmg file on macOS, or .tar.gz file on Linux) and follow the on-screen instructions.

- During the installation process, you may be asked to specify the installation directory. Choose an appropriate location on your system and proceed with the installation.

- After the installation is complete, launch Spring Tool Suite.

- On the initial startup, you may be prompted to select a workspace directory. Choose a directory where you want to store your projects and click "Launch" to proceed.

- Once the download is complete, run the installer executable (.exe file on Windows, .dmg file on macOS, or .tar.gz file on Linux) and follow the on-screen instructions.
- During the installation process, you may be prompted to choose an installation type. Select the "Developer Default" or "Server Only" option, which includes the MySQL Server and other necessary components for development.
- Proceed with the installation, and you may be asked to set a root password for the MySQL Server. Choose a strong password and remember it as you will need it to access the database.
- Complete the installation process, and make sure to check the option to start the MySQL Server automatically.

        ```
  If the server is running, you should see information about the MySQL version and server status.

- To interact with the MySQL Server, you can use the MySQL Command-Line Client or a graphical user interface (GUI) tool like MySQL Workbench.
MySQL Command-Line Client:

       - Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
       - Run the following command to start the MySQL Command-Line Client and enter the root password when prompted: mysql -u root -p

- Once the download is complete, run the installer executable (.msi file on Windows, .pkg file on macOS, or .tar.gz file on Linux) and follow the on-screen instructions.
- During the installation process, you may be prompted to choose the installation directory. You can keep the default directory or choose a different location as per your preference.
- Proceed with the installation, and you may be asked to accept the license agreement and select additional components. Generally, the default options are sufficient for most users, so you can continue with the default selections.
- Complete the installation process, and make sure to check the option to include Node.js in the system's PATH environment variable. This allows you to run Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) commands from any directory in the command prompt or terminal.
- To verify if Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and run the following commands:```node -v
npm -v```

```
VS CODE EDITOR
```

- Visit the official Visual Studio Code website: https://code.visualstudio.com/

- On the homepage, you will see a "Download for [Your Operating System]" button. Click on it to start the download.

- Once the download is complete, run the installer executable (.exe file on Windows, .dmg file on macOS, or .deb/.rpm file on Linux) and follow the on-screen instructions.

- During the installation process, you may be prompted to choose the installation directory and select additional components. You can keep the default settings or choose a different location as per your preference.
